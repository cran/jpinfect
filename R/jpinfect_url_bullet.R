#'
#' @description
#' This function displays the URLs of Infectious Diseases Weekly Report (IDWR)
#' from the Japan Institute for Health Security (JIHS) for a specified year and weeks, based on
#' the chosen language (English or Japanese).
#' See this webpage for further details: https://id-info.jihs.go.jp/
#'
#' @param year An integer specifying the year of the data. Must be provided explicitly and should be after 2021.
#' @param week A numeric vector specifying the weeks to display URLs for (default is 1:53).
#'             Week numbers should be between 1 and 53.
#' @param language A character string specifying the language of the data ('en' for English, 'jp' for Japanese).
#'                 Default is 'en'.
#'
#' @return A character vector of constructed URLs for the specified weeks and language. If the data
#'         is not available for certain weeks, a message is displayed, and those weeks are skipped.
#'
#' @details
#' - The function constructs URLs for each week using the IDWR data source for the specified language.
#' - The year must be explicitly provided and must be greater than 2023.
#' - Week numbers must be valid (1 to 53), otherwise an error is raised.
#' - If the IDWR data is not available for a particular week, a warning is displayed, and that week is skipped.
#' - Progress updates are provided in the console using `message()`.
